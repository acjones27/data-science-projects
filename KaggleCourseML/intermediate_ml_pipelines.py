# In this tutorial, you will learn how to use pipelines to clean up your modeling code.

# Introduction
# Pipelines are a simple way to keep your data preprocessing and modeling code organized. Specifically, a pipeline bundles preprocessing and modeling steps so you can use the whole bundle as if it were a single step.

# Many data scientists hack together models without pipelines, but pipelines have some important benefits. Those include:

# Cleaner Code: Accounting for data at each step of preprocessing can get messy. With a pipeline, you won't need to manually keep track of your training and validation data at each step.
# Fewer Bugs: There are fewer opportunities to misapply a step or forget a preprocessing step.
# Easier to Productionize: It can be surprisingly hard to transition a model from a prototype to something deployable at scale. We won't go into the many related concerns here, but pipelines can help.
# More Options for Model Validation: You will see an example in the next tutorial, which covers cross-validation.

# Step 1: Define Preprocessing StepsÂ¶
# Similar to how a pipeline bundles together preprocessing and modeling steps, we use the ColumnTransformer class to bundle together different preprocessing steps. The code below:

# imputes missing values in numerical data, and
# imputes missing values and applies a one-hot encoding to categorical data.

# Step 2: Define the Model
# Next, we define a random forest model with the familiar RandomForestRegressor class.

# Step 3: Create and Evaluate the Pipeline
# Finally, we use the Pipeline class to define a pipeline that bundles the preprocessing and modeling steps. There are a few important things to notice:

# With the pipeline, we preprocess the training data and fit the model in a single line of code. (In contrast, without a pipeline, we have to do imputation, one-hot encoding, and model training in separate steps. This becomes especially messy if we have to deal with both numerical and categorical variables!)
# With the pipeline, we supply the unprocessed features in X_valid to the predict() command, and the pipeline automatically preprocesses the features before generating predictions. (However, without a pipeline, we have to remember to preprocess the validation data before making predictions.)

# Conclusion
# Pipelines are valuable for cleaning up machine learning code and avoiding errors, and are especially useful for workflows with sophisticated data preprocessing

# "Cardinality" means the number of unique values in a column
# Select categorical columns with relatively low cardinality (convenient but arbitrary)

# Preprocessing for numerical data

# Preprocessing for categorical data
categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps = [
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='constant', fill_value='missing')),

# Define model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, criterion = "mae", random_state=0, max_depth = 50) # Your code here

# Run the code cell below without changes.

# To pass this step, you need to have defined a pipeline in **Part A** that achieves lower MAE than the code above.  You're encouraged to take your time here and try out many different approaches, to see how low you can get the MAE!
