# Data Science Work

This started as a repo for storing all the code/notes I made whilst working through the Data Scientist in R Track in Data Camp.

It is meant as a record for me but maybe it's useful to someone else.

Added the Advanced Git training I gave in Social Point to the Wiki [here](https://github.com/sp-anna-jones/DataScienceWork/wiki/Git-Advanced-Wiki)
