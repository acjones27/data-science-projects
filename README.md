# Data Science Work

This started as a repo for storing all the code/notes I made whilst working through the Data Scientist in R Track in Data Camp.

In the end, it has a lot of other data science, statistics, Python and R-related topics in it from other sources that I've found along the way.

It is meant as a record for me but maybe it's useful to someone else.
