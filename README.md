# DataCamp

This started as a repo for storing all the code/notes I make while trying to complete the Data Scientist in R Track in Data Camp.
In the end, it has a lot of other data/statistics/R-related topics in it from other sources I've found whilst learning R, Python and Data Analysis/Data Science in general.

It is meant as a record for me but maybe it's useful to someone else.
